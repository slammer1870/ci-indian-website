              We have a strong commitment to our customers to be able to deliver
              fine dining at home. The core tenets of our Covid Policy are:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                All food is prepared by staff that are socially distanced.
              </li>
              <li>We solely accept cardless payment or online purchases.</li>
              <li>
                Food collection is done via a one way system with limited number
                in any given area of the building.
              </li>
              <li>
                Our delivery drivers wear masks and will keep 2 meters of
                distance when dropping off our food.
              </li>
